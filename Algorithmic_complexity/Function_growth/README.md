# Function growth

Consider the classes 

1. O(log n), o(log n), Ω(log n) and ⍵(log n)
3. O(n), o(n), Ω(n), and ⍵(n)
4. O(n²), o(n²), Ω(n²), and ⍵(n²)
5. O(2ⁿ), o(2ⁿ), Ω(2ⁿ), ⍵(2ⁿ)

**Exercise:** For each of the functions below, determine which of the 16 classes it belongs in. Remember that the complexity classes overlap, so for example, if f ∈ o(g) then f ∈ O(g) as well, and if f ∈ Θ(g) then f ∈ O(g) as well as Ω(g) (but f ∉ o(g) and f ∉ ⍵(g)).

1. f(n) = 23 × n
2. f(n) = 42 × n² - 100 × n
3. f(n) = n / log(n)
4. f(n) = log(n) / n
5. f(n) = n²/log(n)
6. f(n) = log(n) + log(n)/n
7. f(n) = 5ⁿ - n³
8. f(n) = n!
9. f(n) = 2ⁿ/n
10. f(n) = log(log(n))
