# Binary search

We argued that the worst-case running time for the binary search is O(log n).

**Exercise:** What is the best-case running time, and what would the input data look like to achieve it?

**Answer:** If the very first element we see is the one we are looking for, i.e. if it at the midpoint of the range, then we finish in constant time.
