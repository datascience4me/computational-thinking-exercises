# Exercises in Computational Thinking

This folder and the folders nested in it contains exercises and solutions to the exercises for *”Introduction to Computational Thinking”*.

To get the most benefit from the exercises, you should always attempt to solve a problem before you look at my solution. If you haven’t tried to solve a problem first, you will not appreciate how difficult it would be to solve on your own; you will very easily fool yourself into thinking that you can quickly solve problems that would, in fact, be difficult to handle. It quite frankly is *much* easier to see how a solution works compared to derive it in the first place. My solutions are here to help you if you get stuck and for you to examine once you have arrived at your own answer. Even if you have solved a problem correctly, you might learn something from reading my version.
